### Topics Covered
- Programming terminology
	- Statement: A statement is a part of the program which executes something. It often, but not always, refers to a single command.
    - Block: A block is a group of consecutive statements that are at the same level in the structure of the program.
    - Expression: An expression is a bit of code that results in a determined data type. When the program is executed, the expression is evaluated so that it has a value that can then be used in the program.
    - Function: A function executes some functionality. Functions can also take one or more arguments, which are data that can be fed to and processed by the function. 
    - Type: Data type refers to the characteristics of any value present in the program.
    - Syntax (semantics): Similarly to natural languages, the syntax of a programming language determines how the code of a program should be written.
    - Debugging: If the syntax of the program is correct but the program still doesn't function as intended, there is a bug in the program.
- Using (len) to parse string for its length
- Floor functions in Python cause for floats to be rounded down to integers
- Python comparison operators can also be used on strings. String a is smaller than string b if it comes alphabetically before b.
	- Does require that the characters are all of the same case
- Logical operators (i.e. and / or)
- Conditionals and nested conditionals (including if, elif, & else)
- Simple loops
- Debugging print statements
