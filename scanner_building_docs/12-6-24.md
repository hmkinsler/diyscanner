# Progress Update
- Day five of building, 3D parts update, laser cut parts update, and began web page design
- Jon and I stopped by Geneâ€™s home to pick up more 3D parts that he had completed, as well as most of the parts for the [lighting module](https://diybookscanner.org/archivist/indexfe70.html?page_id=253), including:
    - The [front and rear plate](https://diybookscanner.org/archivist/indexfe70.html?page_id=253#:~:text=Large%20Front/Rear%20Plate) of the lighting module
    - Two [large baffles](https://diybookscanner.org/archivist/indexfe70.html?page_id=253#:~:text=This%20is%20the-,Large%20Baffle,-of%20the%20Lighting) for the lighting module
    - Two [small baffles](https://diybookscanner.org/archivist/indexfe70.html?page_id=253#:~:text=This%20is%20the-,Small%20Baffle,-of%20the%20Lighting) for the lighting module
    - [Two cradle wings](https://diybookscanner.org/archivist/index96cb.html?page_id=141)
    - [The cradle base](https://diybookscanner.org/archivist/index08d2.html?page_id=131)
    - Two [camera mounts](https://diybookscanner.org/archivist/indexed66.html?page_id=135)
    - Two replacement [short arms](https://diybookscanner.org/archivist/indexc361.html?page_id=137)
    - Two replacement [long arms](https://diybookscanner.org/archivist/indexa7df.html?page_id=133)
- Gene had also successfully cut [two camera access doors](https://diybookscanner.org/archivist/indexfe70.html?page_id=253#:~:text=This%20is%20the-,Camera%20Access%20Door,-of%20the%20Lighting) for the lighting module and still needed to cut the [two side plates](https://diybookscanner.org/archivist/indexfe70.html?page_id=253#:~:text=Large%20Side%20Plate%20of%20the%20Lighting%20Module.) for the lighting module, so Jon and I agreed to come back at a later date to pick up those parts
- Disassembled broken 3D printed parts from base in exchange for newer parts that were printed with 100% infill
- Sanded camera mounts to prepare for later assembly of the camera module
- Assembled the cradle
- Added a hidden page to the [*Fourth Ward Oral History Project*](https://www.fourthwardhistory.org/) website to begin including information about the scanner project for CRD 702
