# Progress Update
- I attempted to make use of the [Spreads](https://spreads.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.2/index.html) software instead, to see if I could install the legacy packages on my computer; I opted to do this because of how well-recommended the software is and because it was developed specifically for use with the scanner design I am using for this project
- Successfully installed Python 2 onto my laptop and set-up a virtual environment
    - I found that there were a lot of differences in running code between Python 2 and Python 3, which I had been using up until this point, and that made it very difficult to figure out how to set-up the virtual environment without making Python 2 the base version for my machine – apparently making virtual environments so readily is something that had to be done with specific libraries that are not always accessible in earlier versions, from what I can tell
    - Spreads is specifically designed to be used with [Canon Hack Development Kit](https://chdk.fandom.com/wiki/CHDK) (CHDK) compatible devices. CHDK is a software that allows for certain Canon cameras to be more fully operated from a computer, but I was not easily able to source two CHDK cameras within the project timeline, so I decided to instead see if I could find an alternative way to do this with my Nikon D3500.
    - I found that the [Spreads GitHub documentation](https://github.com/DIYBookScanner/spreads) also mentioned yet another legacy software, [libgphoto2](http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/), which broadens the options for which cameras are compatible with the program. I attempted to see if the Nikon D3500 was listed as being [compatible with libgphoto2 under its newest release](http://gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php), and it is, so I thought I might be able to set-up that program and then interface it with Spreads and then just use all of the legacy software for image processing, as opposed to developing my own software.
    - I attempted to set-up libgphoto2 and quickly learned through the [GitHub documentation](https://github.com/gphoto/libgphoto2) that it is meant to be installed and operated using Linux, so I spent quite a bit of time setting up a virtual machine for Ubuntu on my laptop, and then using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl), found a way to configure [VS Code for development with Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/developing-in-wsl/?source=recommendations) so I would do that and also continue to work on setting everything up for potentially running Spreads on the same machine.
    - I quickly realized that running code in Linux is, of course, very different. I have had some experience working with Ubuntu previously, but not much. All the same, I began working on setting up Python2 on the virtual machine since it is required for proper set-up of libgphoto2, and despite hours of trying, I ultimately just was not able to successfully install all of the legacy libraries I needed. I think there may be some old library packages that are not accessible or that the old links for accessing the libraries’ installation pages have since changed or been removed, so I decided to stop going with this route for the image processing software at this point to begin developing my own program instead.
