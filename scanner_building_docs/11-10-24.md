# Progress Updates
- Hardware list successfully completed based on dimensions in our design. Some of the biggest issues with the hardware documentation included a lack of explanation about what kinds of metric bolts should be used, but we eventually figured out that, in some cases, we needed both hex bolts and socket head bolts, whereas in others we could use machine screws

- Lack of clarity about the bearings â€“ it seemed to be the case that we were supposed to use skateboard bearings, based on this [additional documentation about the mixed units](https://diybookscanner.org/archivist/index9d48.html?page_id=334) being used for the hardware in the scanner tutorial documentation, but my partner and I agreed that, in some cases, we may have to design our own alternative parts and make adjustments simply through the building process once all of the 3D printed parts were ready.

- Jon finished printing the two cradle lifters
