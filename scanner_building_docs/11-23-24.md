# Progress Update
- Day one of building
- Acquired the first round of needed hardware for the project, this took hours at both Home Depot and Lowes because their selection for metric parts was limited, and it took us a really long time to figure out how to navigate the way they store their hardware and be sure that we were getting the right parts. I learned a lot about how to find specific bolts, nuts, etc.
- Assembled much of the base
- Began staining wooden pieces for the base
