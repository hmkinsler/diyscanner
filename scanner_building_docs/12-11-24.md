# Progress Updates
- Finished working on the website page for the project
- Make the project GitHub repository public and issued first release for purpose of CRD 702 documentation
- Finished working on this document for the class project!

# Skills Developed
- How to assemble wooden pieces – this is useful as I would like to learn more about carpentry in the future
- How to cut glass
- How to locate and understand the dimensions and types of many basic kinds of hardware, as well as how important the difference between metric and imperial measurements are
- How to make use of GitHub – I still do not fully understand the process, but what I have already learned so far has been helpful in allowing me to edit my code from multiple places and machines
- How to stain wood and find the right paint for different kinds of surfaces – also helpful for learning about carpentry and building things with wood and other materials in the future
- I continued to develop my Python programming skills, learning more about:
    - How to identify variables
    - How to set up virtual environments for different versions of Python
    - How to find documentation for specific libraries
    - How to set-up a program with multiple Python scripts that call each other – this was easily the most transformative thing I learned about programming while working on this project; I had not considered before how much more efficient it would be to organize different parts of the program across different scripts, and figuring this out also gave me a much better understanding of how to read through and navigate GitHub repositories.
    - How different kinds of data types are referred to
    - How to install libraries

# Next Steps
- Submit records request for materials relating to the City of Raleigh’s urban redevelopment projects in the Fourth Ward and Smokey Hollow neighborhoods and use scanner to digitize these records
- Work on compiling and organizing documentation materials to present at future conferences and begin developing a publication
