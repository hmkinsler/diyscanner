# Project Proposal
The main goal is to attempt to build a DIY book scanner, particularly ["The Archivist"](https://diybookscanner.org/archivist/index.html) model that was developed and documented by Daniel Reetz. This was one of several models listed on a [DIY book scanner](https://diybookscanner.org/) site that includes community forums and lots of great information on how to build these kinds of scanners.

My partner, Jonathan, is an architectural drafter who works primarily with AutoCAD in the design of aluminum composite panels (ACP) for the exterior of commercial buildings. He has been working with the CNC operator at his workplace, as well as the design manager, to work on using scrap ACP to cut pieces with the same dimensions as many of the panels for the scanner we are building. As of now, he has made some modifications to the files listed on the website to adjust the thickness to better accommodate the materials we are using, and the design files have been sent to his coworkers to see if they are approved for production.

He has also used the files listed on the website to select some parts to be 3D printed, so those will be completed this week.

In the meantime, I will be working on experimenting to see if I can set-up a controller for the cameras that will be used for the scanner. The site includes some information on how to do this using a [Raspberry Pi set-up.](https://diybookscanner.org/archivist/indexee7f.html?page_id=846)

My hope is to either write and submit a reflection on the project, as far as it progresses. Alternatively, depending on my progress, I am considering reaching out to the [Society of North Carolina Archivists](https://www.ncarchivists.org/) to see if that may be a viable venue for publication or presenting this work and preparing materials for that.
