- Worked on modifying GUI to make it more user friendly and visually appealing
- I spent a lot of time on trying to make the GUI resizable and changing the formatting because I want to be able to later on set-up an area for previewing images so that users can modify the post-processing settings more easily â€“ I have only gotten so far with this
- I also continued to make changes to the scripts for:
    - Image capture
    - Image processing
    - OCR
- Overall, the scripts are working at a very barebones level as intended, apart from the OCR processing script, which I am not planning to develop until much later on
