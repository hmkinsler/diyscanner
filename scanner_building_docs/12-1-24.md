# Progress Update
- Jon and I returned to Geneâ€™s to check in on the laser cutting progress. Unfortunately, this is still taking a substantial amount of passes, so he had only successfully cut the two [front/rear plates of the lighting module](https://diybookscanner.org/archivist/indexfe70.html?page_id=253#:~:text=Large%20Front/Rear%20Plate%20of%20the%20Lighting%20Module.). While there, Jon helped make adjustments to the rest of the lighting module parts DXF files using AutoCAD and we were able to also cut the [first camera access door](https://diybookscanner.org/archivist/indexfe70.html?page_id=253#:~:text=This%20is%20the-,Camera%20Access%20Door,-of%20the%20Lighting). When we left, the second camera access door was in the process of being laser cut.
