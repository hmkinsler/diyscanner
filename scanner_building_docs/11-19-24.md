# Progress Update
- Began developing a Python program using generative AI (Chat-GPT4.o) for image capture and processing
    - Got as far as being able to take photos with my Nikon D3500 through Python code after setting up [DigiCamControl](https://digicamcontrol.com/download) on my laptop to use its [command line utility](https://digicamcontrol.com/doc/userguide/cmd)
    - Began working on modular structure for the software and got as far as having scripts for:
        - Image capture â€“ operating correctly with my Nikon D3500
        - Generation of PDF with captured images
        - Some post-processing of images (i.e. image cropping and brightening)
        - Successfully completed a [test run of PDF creation](eng810\scanner_building_docs\tests\scanned_book_test.pdf) with some photos of my cat
    - Began developing GUI for the program
    - Jonathan also requested that his dad help us source a piece for the [cradle handlebar](https://diybookscanner.org/archivist/indexdb4c.html?page_id=191) and 3D print us two [cradle angles](https://diybookscanner.org/archivist/index6da1.html?page_id=139), as well as a [cradle lift stop](https://diybookscanner.org/archivist/index67b5.html?page_id=681)
